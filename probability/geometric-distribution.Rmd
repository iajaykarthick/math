Geometric Distribution is the distribution of the number of trials needed to get the first success in repeated independent Bernoulli trials.

For the first success to occur on the $x^{th}$ trial:
1. The first $x-1$ trials must be failures (Probability for this to happen is $(1-p)^{(x-1)}$)
2. $x^{th}$ trial must be a success (Probability for this to happen is $p$)

Hence, 
\[P[X=x] = (1-p)^{(x-1)}p \\
\text{ for x = 1, 2, 3,...}
\]
